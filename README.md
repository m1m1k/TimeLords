# TimeLords
Journey to a far away land as we embark on the first history making jump through time.

# CONCEPT
A graphical strategy Rougelike RPG attempting to follow D20 rules, adding graphics, and interesting mechanics.
Rather than invent a mythical world, we'll be traveling back through time to the ancient Roman Empire.
Players will achieve greatness or die trying while being immersed in thrilling historical fiction.

## CHAPTER 0 : INTRO : BEFORE I left Earth - the TEST
OVERVIEW: you are about to become the first time traveller in the world
Little do you know that you will inevitably get stuck in the Ancient past.
You'll have to battle your way BACK TO THE FUTURE or figure out how to survive here in the past.

---
*Greetings time traveller recruits!*
The interplanetary council has prepared some rigorous tests for you before you delve into the deepest mysteries of the future.
The council has decided that since the galaxy's top minds are not in agreement about how going back in time may alter our present course,
and indeed it may be highly catastrophic if you were to alter the course of humanity,
we have decided to make the PAST strictly forbidden.  
Our space-time folding ship prototype has been fitted with a special governer device which should only allow time travel 
back to this period of time and no further back in time.
Again, anything that you do in the past, may very well erase the present as we know it, 
so if by some off chance you should find yourself in the past, 
don't communicate with anyone, don't interact with anyone, and by all that is holy, don't kill anything.
The second rule of time travel is, be an observer.  We want to learn as much about the future as possible.
If you can, bring us back something from the future that might help advance our race's (somewhat low) stature in the present galaxy.

*Also, please note*
Time travel requires an enormous amount of energy to fold space time.  
We've decided to use the energy of our closest neighbor star Andromeda, 
which will be totally wiped out and hopefully not turn into a black hole and kill us all.
Trials are highly contested because of potential time-space tremors, possible creation of dark matter or black holes, 
ripping space time, wiping out the human race, Paradoxes, etc.
You have been randomly selected from all applicants and I see from your application that you:
1. Once ate chicken so good it made you slap your mama in the neck?
2. Once won a lard eating contest, then realized it wasn't lard?
3. Believe a spiritual voice tells you to do strange strange things?
4. Habitually watch cat videos from dawn until dusk?

... (Character creation)


* The First trial run is conducted:
This will be a trial run only.  We will jump you 3 minutes into the future.  
Since it's so short, the energy required is quite a bit less, 
and we're planning to deplete the earth's nuclear arsenal all at once, so it'll be two birds with one stone.
Keeping around old plutonium was always a bad idea anyways, 
but now we'll have world peace and we will be crossing into a new frontier.
"I hope this works..."

## CHAPTER 1 : LANDFALL - survival of the skittisht
*Well that was exciting!*
It seems that the front half of your craft is now half embedded in bedrock.
The readouts of your ship display flash a few times, then go dark.
Well, crap.

Thankfully, you had a few personal effects in your backpack and pockets.  
They are: a gps watch, a cell phone with camera (no signal - go figure), your handy time travelers international survival kit (TTiSK).
And some old MRE rations which just happened to be in your coat.

*You find yourself cold and alone in a dark, wet place.*

Now, to find some future people and help me get out of here.
