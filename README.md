# TimeLords
Journey to a far away land as we embark on the first history making jump through time.

## CONCEPT
A *graphical* strategy Rougelike RPG attempting to follow D20 rules, adding graphics, and interesting mechanics.
Rather than invent a mythical world, we'll be traveling back through time to the ancient Roman Empire.
Players will achieve greatness or die trying while being immersed in thrilling historical fiction.
Game Engine: Unity3D, C#
2.5D top down style 2D sprites => pokemon/fftactics/original sid meyers civilization style.
Textual style will be gritty, satirical, and humorous (hopefully).  
Graphics will be Bright, colorful, and the ridiculous yet serious world will contrast character's humour-as-a-coping strategy, and nonchalance.  

## CHAPTER 0 : BEFORE I left Earth...
*OVERVIEW: you are about to become the first time traveller in the world.
 Little do you know that you will inevitably get stuck in the Ancient past.
You'll have to battle your way *BACK TO THE FUTURE* or figure out how to survive here in the past.*

---

*Greetings time traveller recruits!*
The interplanetary council has prepared some rigorous tests for you before you delve into the deepest mysteries of the future.
The council has decided that since the galaxy's top minds are not in agreement about how going back in time may alter our present course,
and indeed it may be highly catastrophic if you were to alter the course of humanity,
we have decided to make the PAST strictly forbidden.  
Our space-time folding ship prototype has been fitted with a special governer device which should only allow time travel 
back to this period of time and no further back in time.
Again, anything that you do in the past, may very well erase the present as we know it, 
so if by some off chance you should find yourself in the past, 
don't communicate with anyone, don't interact with anyone, and by all that is holy, don't kill anything.
The second rule of time travel is, be an observer.  We want to learn as much about the future as possible.
If you can, bring us back something from the future that might help advance our race's (somewhat low) stature in the present galaxy.

*Also, please note*
Time travel requires an enormous amount of energy to fold space time.  
We've decided to use the energy of our closest neighbor star Andromeda, 
which will be totally wiped out and hopefully not turn into a black hole and kill us all.
Trials are highly contested because of potential time-space tremors, possible creation of anti matter rifts or black holes, 
ripping space time, wiping out the human race, Paradoxes, etc.
However, we feel that the benefits could outweigh the probable disasterou-, ahem, the consequences.
You have been randomly selected from all applicants and I see from your application that you:
1. Once ate chicken so good it made you slap your mama in the neck?
2. Once won a lard eating contest, then realized it wasn't lard?
3. Believe a spiritual voice tells you to do strange strange things?
4. Habitually watch cat videos from dawn until dusk?

... (Character creation happens here - TBD maybe not so silly?)

---

* The First trial run is conducted:
This will be a trial run only.  We will jump you 3 minutes into the future.  
Since it's so short, the energy required is quite a bit less, 
and we're planning to use some of the earth's nuclear arsenal, 
so it'll be two birds with one stone.
Keeping around old plutonium was always a bad idea anyways, 
but now maybe we'll be one step closer to world peace and we will be crossing into a new frontier.
Besides, all the aliens we've met so far use Fusion cannons and Tritanium alloys 
so the nukes wouldn't do much good against them anyways.


"I hope this works..."
*crosses fingers*

You sit back in the cockpit, gripping the seat tightly. Your heart races.
The lights of the craft surge as power is pumped into them.
The plasma engine whirrs to life and you feel the infrasonic vibrations begin to vibrate your chest cavity.
All the lights in the room suddenly get extremely bright.  
A low, bassy metalic humming now enters the range of human hearing, now whispering, now roaring and
drowning out the noise of the technicians and crowd who has gathered to watch the event.
Power surges all around you.  Electric arcs spider their way around the landing platform.
Blue light flashes, then white light engulfs the room, and a thousand pounds of pressure 
suddenly seek to crush you with G-forces as you feel you are being sucked down a drain.
You try to call out, but it does no good.  You are pressed back into the padded seat.
With muscles straining, you fight to barely raise your head against the forces.
Professor Turbine is waving his arms excitedly as if something is wrong.
Now he's cupping his hands around his mouth and trying to yell something.
Man full?  Trample?  Candle?
Ah, it's *cancel*.  As in, cancel the experiment, cancel the flight.
You look down at the control board and in the bright white light everything looks wrong.
You could've sworn that the date was supposed to be {TODAY}, 
but now the year is spinning like a slot machine.
With effort, you reach out your hand slowly towards the large red "ABORT" button. 
...
Almost there.  Your eyes bulge out of their sockets as 10,000 pounds of pressure squeezes you like a rotten lemon.

### ZAP ###
## POOF ##
# BIFF #
...
Your finger trembles as every muscle in your body strives to push out.
You finally barely brush open the case overtop button...
### ZAP ###
## POOF ##
## POOF ##
# HISSssssssssssssss...... #
... You pass out.
### ZAP ###





## CHAPTER 1 : LANDFALL, survival
*Well that was exciting!*
I guess it must have worked, since you are no longer in the test lab.
Your body aches all over, and a trickle of blood runs down from the corner of your nose.
You seem to be inside a cave.
The front half of your craft is now half embedded in bedrock.  
That's not going to be easy to dig out.
The readouts of your ship display flash a few times, then go dark. 
The power cell was probably cut by the rocks.
Well, crap.

Thankfully, you had a few personal effects in your backpack and pockets.  
They are: a gps watch, a cell phone with camera (no signal - go figure), your handy time travelers international survival kit (TTiSK).
And some old MRE rations which just happened to be in your coat.

*You find yourself cold and alone in a dark, wet place.*

Now, to find some future people and help me get out of here...
